# Sensory Perception
### A GNOME Shell Extension

Forked from https://github.com/xtranophilist/gnome-shell-extension-sensors

## Installation

### Manual

```
git clone https://github.com/HarlemSquirrel/gnome-shell-extension-sensory-perception.git
ln -s ~/gnome-shell-extension-sensory-perception ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/sensory-perception@HarlemSquirrel.github.io
```

## Customizing labels

You may want to set the labels of your sensors to something like 'CPU' instead of 'temp1'. Every motherboard is different so you will need to set these labels manually. I created [lm-sensors-chip-labels](https://github.com/HarlemSquirrel/lm-sensors-chip-labels) where I am adding the files I need for my machines. Feel free to open a PR and contribute!
